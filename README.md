# Florida Non-Owner Affidavit

This site is designed for anyone who no longer owns a vehicle but that vehicle is still registered with the state of Florida. The real issue comes when you cancel your auto insurance on that vehicle. Due to a lack of insurance, the state of Florida will suspend your Driver's License. You can check your Driver's License's status at [this page.]()
